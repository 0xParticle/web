            <strong>
              We started as a small group of activists with diverse backgrounds.
              Coding, Big Data, Finance and VC are our cup of tea.
            </strong>

            <span>
              We met while collaborating with several DeFi protocols in the
              early days and decided to join forces into one organization that
              would let us scale and make a much bigger impact which would
              become DeFi Wonderland.

            <span>
              We currently work as an activist fund but we share the ethos of
              the ecosystem, creating much more value than the one we take: we
              grow projects, communities, markets in a more decentralized and
              self-sustainable manner, only proffiting when the value we add is
              exponentially higher than the one weâ€™ll extract.

            <strong>
              We're value creators, always seeking to understand the ecosystem
              needs and interests, providing valuable propositions that address
              them, and that's how we will remain, it's our ethos.
            </strong>

            <span>
              We believe DeFi is mind boggling and will open an array of
              possibilities all around the world, but especially for people that
              have been left behind by the current financial system.
            </span>

            <span>We will help DeFi achieve scale through our code.</span>
